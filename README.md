This repository contains a prototype project for `System.Date` and `System.TimeOfDay`.

This is an unofficial community-based effort, being used to coordinate an implementation that *could* ultimately be merged into the .NET CoreCLR.  **Nothing here is intended to be usable in its current state.**

For more details, see [dotnet/corefx#700](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/700).
